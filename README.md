## Professional Summary

I am an AI/ML Engineer with a strong focus on **applied machine learning, AI agent systems, cybersecurity, and enterprise risk engineering**.

My work centres on designing and deploying **production-style AI systems** that are:
- explainable
- auditable
- risk-aware
- suitable for real operational environments

I build **end-to-end systems**  from data processing and model logic to APIs, documentation, and live demos rather than experimental notebooks.

## Selected Projects (Live & Verifiable Evidence)

### 1) NxtAbroad AI; Visa Readiness & Eligibility Agent (Live)

**Role:** Founder & Lead AI/ML Engineer  
**Type:** Applied AI decision-support system

🔗 **Live API Documentation:**  
https://nxtabroad-ai-demo.onrender.com/docs  

🔗 **Repository:**  
https://github.com/akinyeraakintunde/nxtabroad-visa-readiness-ml  

**Description:**  
Designed and implemented a **rules-first, explainable AI agent** that evaluates visa readiness and eligibility using structured inputs.

The system produces:
- eligibility indicators
- risk-aware scoring
- clear, auditable recommendations

Built to reduce ambiguity, support advisors, and improve consistency in high-stakes decision workflows.

### 2) Enterprise Risk Intelligence Engine (Live)

**Role:** AI/ML Engineer & System Designer  
**Type:** Open-source applied risk intelligence system

🔗 **Live Demo:**  
https://enterprise-risk-intelligence-engine.onrender.com  

🔗 **Repository:**  
https://github.com/akinyeraakintunde/enterprise-risk-intelligence-engine  

**Description:**  
Developed a risk intelligence engine that ingests log/event data and generates:
- Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)
- anomaly estimates
- normalised risk scores
- short narrative risk summaries

Designed to **reduce alert noise** and support faster, more informed investigation and escalation decisions.

---

### 3) Public Sector AI Platform; Multi-Agent Architecture

**Type:** Multi-agent system prototype

🔗 **Repository:**  
https://github.com/akinyeraakintunde/public-sector-ai-platform  

**Description:**  
Built a modular **multi-agent platform skeleton** designed for public-sector and enterprise workflows, featuring:
- task routing agents
- retrieval and context agents
- audit and validation layers
- guardrail-driven execution flow

Demonstrates **agent orchestration, separation of concerns, and backend-first design**.

---

### 4) Network Intrusion Detection; ML Security Pipeline

**Type:** Applied cybersecurity ML project

🔗 **Repository:**  
https://github.com/akinyeraakintunde/network-intrusion-detection-ml  

**Description:**  
Implemented a machine-learning-based intrusion detection pipeline with an engineering-first structure, focusing on:
- feature engineering from network traffic
- classification and evaluation
- monitoring-aligned security interpretation

Demonstrates applied ML within **cyber defense and security monitoring contexts**.

---

### 5) Twitter Topic Classifier  NLP Pipeline

**Type:** Applied NLP classification project

🔗 **Repository:**  
https://github.com/akinyeraakintunde  

**Description:**  
Built an NLP pipeline using TF-IDF and classical ML techniques to classify social media content into predefined categories, with evaluation metrics and reproducible workflow.

---

## Security & Compliance Experience

- **Connected Health (Belfast, UK)**  Cybersecurity & Compliance Support  
  Contributed to **Cyber Essentials PLUS** through patch compliance verification, secure configuration activities, vulnerability management, and audit evidence support in a regulated environment.

This experience demonstrates the application of digital technology within **high-assurance and compliance-driven contexts**.

---

## Technical Stack

**Languages:** Python  
**Backend:** FastAPI, Pydantic, REST APIs, OpenAPI  
**AI / ML:** scikit-learn, feature engineering, evaluation pipelines  
**Agent Systems:** routing logic, validation, structured outputs, guardrails  
**DevOps:** GitHub Actions, CI basics, Docker fundamentals, Render deployment  
**Security:** risk modelling mindset, auditability, governance-aware engineering  

---

## Technical Philosophy

My approach prioritises:
- validating data before escalation
- understanding context, impact, and urgency
- using AI to **support human judgment**, not replace it
- clear documentation for investigation and handover

This reflects practical experience in **monitoring, analysis, and decision-making under pressure**.
